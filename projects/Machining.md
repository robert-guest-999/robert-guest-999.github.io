Hobbyist machining is an expensive but entertaining pursuit. Traditional fullscale equipment like a metal working lathe and milling machine can cost thousands of euros to purchase new, and require a large amount of space to utilise. 

In a stroke of luck I found out that there is a semi funtional full scale metal lathe in my grandad's workshop that seems to be from somewhere in the early to mid 20th century. It hasn't been used in at least twenty years, and is gummed up with grease, dust and metal shavings. I've purchased five litres of industrial degreaser as well as some paint stripper and a few wirebrush attachments for my cordless drill.

The rough plan is to dissasemble the lathe piece by piece and to recondition the components by giving them a thorough clean, degrease, and oiling.

I'll start with the more accessible parts such as the tailstock, toolpost and cross-slide. Once these are removed and cleaned, I can scrub the bed and ways before reinstalling them and ensuring that they move smoothly. There's a patina of rust on the ways, but the pitting seems minimal.
