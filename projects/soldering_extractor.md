title: "Soldering Extractor"
description: "attachment for removing harmful soldering fumes"

My soldering setup was lacking a fume extractor so I made one from scratch. I didn't have any fans lying around so i made one out of an brushed dc hard-drive motor and some 3D printed parts. It consists of an inner motor holder connected to a protective enclosure for the fan blades. The fan itself is a five bladed axial design with a ring to increase rigidity. OpenSCAD was used to create the model and it was printed on a BambuLabs A1.
